# Active Tasks
- Default values for config options (typing `;case-sensitive` would set the default value)
- more config options
    - show-answer: shows correct answer after user submission

# Future Tasks
- Tons of Documentation
- Bug Hunting
- Binary/Precompiled Quizzes
    - Allow quizzes to be compiled into the Quiz object ahead of time and 
    printed into a file (careful byte-order) as binary to be read by the
    quiz taker at runtime (hides answers / more secure, very dumbly though)
