# ./examples
This directory holds multiple examples/tutorials/templates for/of quizzes.

If you want to learn how to build your own basic quizzes, all you need is the
simple tutorial in `simple-tutorial.txt`. More complicated features like
configuration are explained in the later tutorials: `intermediate-tutorial.qz`
and `advanced-tutorial.qz`, which explain simple config and advanced config
respectively.
